## Embedded SUSE Harvester Application Modernization

### The Challenge

* *Most integrated solutions providers rely on legacy, monolithic applications* that currently provide significant revenue for their business and there is often resistance and even some fear around rebuilding*, from the ground up, a company's top money maker. Such an undertaking can incur a huge cost burden, represent a significant risk and interruption for customers. It is extremely common for the attitude of "if it isn't broken..." to prevail for longer than is actually healthy for the company. 

* *Traditional virtualization and Kubernetes platforms insist on a difficult and risky "lift-and-shift"* method for modernizing monolithic applications into microservices.

* *Legacy virtualization platform providers are struggling to stay relevant in the era of microservices and cloud-native computing.* They have held on to their highly profitable vendor lock-in strategies as long as possible but are now finding it increasingly difficult to offer the value today's customers need. Building Kubernetes clusters on antiquated virtualization platforms only serves to extend the decades-long vendor lock-in, while hobbling the true power of modern compute and containerization technologies. 

* *Solution providers want to modernize their legacy applications*, but may not have the time or resources to dedicate to a single project of completely rebuilding their applications into a modern, microservice architecture. 

* *Customers are increasingly wary of the risk associated with solution providers who continue to invest* in antiquated application architectures rather than modernize their portfolio. Smart customers understand there is risk with every approach and would rather take that risk in small, easily recoverable iterations.


### Architectural Overview

This design leverages many SUSE technologies:
* *SUSE Rancher* as the central point of management, automation, and administration for all virtualization and containerization platforms 
* *SUSE Harvester* as a Kubernetes based, Hyper-Converged Infrastructure (HCI), type-one hypervisor 
** As a fully Hyper-Converged Infrastructure hypervisor, Harvester provides its workloads virtualization, storage, and network resources without additional investment.
* *SUSE Linux Enterprise 15* and *SLE Micro* as the reliable, highly-secure virtual machine operating system
* *K3s* as the Kubernetes distribution for mission-critical containerized workloads 
* *SUSE Base Container Image* as the Enterprise ready, fully supportable application platform image
* *SUSE Professional Services* for guidance on creating the modern application support components such as a secure container image registry and more

The goal of this design is to provide a combined virtual machine and Kubernetes platform that allows solution providers to seamlessly modernize their legacy applications into a microservice architecture through a gradual, well planned roll-out to their customers. This SUSE, best-in-class platform, allows providers to deliver their applications in a hybrid, virtualized plus containerized, mode of operation. 

With this hybrid compute platform, a solution provider and convert portions of their application stack into Kubernetes managed containers, while leaving the rest of the stack unchanged, running inside virtual machines. 

SUSE Harvester supports both persistent and immutable virtual machines. Immutable virtual machines can run portions of an application stack that are not ready to be containerized and do not need to persist data locally. This is just one example of a simple, low-risk step towards translating legacy architectures into the world of microservices.

One of the key differentiators of SUSE Harvester and other Hyper-Converged Infrastructure solutions is that Harvester's virtual machines, K3s Kubernetes clusters, and even public cloud Kubernetes clusters, can be deployed and fully managed by a single SUSE Rancher server. This removes the need for an application development team to maintain experts in a virtualization platform, Kubernetes platform, and public cloud provider. Leveraging the standardized SUSE Rancher API calls easily handles all infrastructure needs.

For the highest level of reliability, the design leverages three virtualization focused servers. The server's CPU, memory, storage, and network capacity can be tailored to the needs of the workload. The minimum recommended per node configuration is eight CPU cores, 32 GB of RAM, 120GB of SSD or NVMe storage, and 1Gb/s network. This configuration works well where the workload is small and predictable. Increasing each node's capacity to 16 CPU cores, 64GB of RAM, 500GB of SSD/NVMe storage and a 25Gb/s network significantly increases the solution's ability to handle busier and highly variable workloads.

Dedicating three nodes to a solution can sometimes be a challenge for remote environments, however this gives the solution the maximum availability and reliability, plus allows for full lights-out management. The solution can also be used in a two node configuration, but with reductions in availability and reliability. 

Absent major infrastructure failures, the two and three node designs operate exactly the same. In the two node configuration, one node would maintain the RKE2 Kubernetes control-plane and etcd datastore as well as run virtual machines. The second node would only run virtual machines. Maintaining frequent backups of the etcd database is key to ensuring recoverability in the event of a major failure of the node hosting the control plan and etcd datastore.

The journey towards modernizing the application is further made easier when using SUSE's Base Container Image (BCI). BCI offers developers a suite of secure, supported, flexible container images on which build modern applications. To enable agile development, each SUSE BCI has full access to the SUSE software repositories with, or without, a support contract. Of course, protecting your applications with a support contract ensures the highest levels of availability and the fastest time to resolution for any unforeseen issues that might occur.


### The Solution

* *Updating a legacy application to take advantage of Kubernetes management and microservices architectures* can massively improve the application's reliability and availability. In addition, a well architected microservice-focused application can scale further and many times quicker than its antiquated cousin. As well, microservice-focused applications are the undisputed champion at reducing development, maintenance, and support costs. SUSE Harvester provides a fully integrated Kubernetes and virtual machine platform that allows modernizing applications in easy to understand and manage portions. This can, in turn, manage the fear of risk that can sometimes paralyze highly competent development teams.

Options exist along this process to further reduce risk by leveraging Kubernetes standard rollback capabilities to return a SUSE Harvester immutable VM or containerized workload to the unchanged state if unexpected behavior is encountered. Lift-and-shift application conversions simply can't offer this level of protection.


* *One of the biggest hurdles to modernizing legacy applications* is that monolithic architectures offer little means to help redevelop an application into a modern architecture. Unfortunately, while Kubernetes is an incredibly powerful application platform, it has a steep learning curve and offers no clear pathway to reach the same goal. What Harvester brings to this particular challenge is the ability to run virtual machines in a Kubernetes context. 

SUSE Harvester creates clear "stepping stones" to help developers begin updating their mode-one applications. These initial steps can be as straight-forward as splitting the application stack into multiple VMs based on statefulness, immutiability, runtime dependencies, or any other characteristic that would affect converting them into a containerized component. This initial step is critical in that it guides the developers into re-imagining/re-developing the application components based on needs such as network, storage, process isolation and more.

With the help of SUSE Professional Services, this step can also include developing and deploying the virtual machine images through Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery pipelines that will also be used to create, manage, and update future container images. This capability is completely unique to SUSE Harvester, but offers an easy on-ramp for developers into modernizing their applications into highly reliable Kubernetes applications.

SUSE Harvester also allows for immutable virtual machines that can be used as a great first step in modernizing portions of an existing application stack. They can be operated in a mode similar to Kubernetes pods (e.g. created/updated via CI/CD, restricted to a Kubernetes namespace, created and destroyed at will, etc.), while the services running inside the immutable VM retain the legacy application architecture.

As experience is gained, the modernization process continues, step-by-step, with additional application components moving from monolythic, to discrete-VM, to K3s Kubernetes-native-containerized; each step with a clear rollback path to minimize risk.


* *Virtual machines still have a big part to play in the modern IT landscape*, however solution providers looking to modernize their applications don't want to take on such a daunting task based on antiquated technology. Doing so would simply reinforce the same limitations and workarounds that have plagued those platforms for decades. SUSE Harvester runs virtual machines on a cutting edge Kubernetes-based platform unleashes previously unimagined potential for interoperability between virtual machines and containerized workloads.


* *Leveraging the flexibility of SUSE Harvester allows the solution provider to manage* the developer resources that are dedicated to modernizing the architecture, without losing momentum because the modernization process is integrated with the normal maintenance of the application that is delivered to their customers. Rather than having to manage multiple work streams, a single code-base is updated, validated, and provided to their customers. 

* *Updating and rolling out architectural updates alongside code updates* lowers the overall operational risk for your customers by ensuring a path to easily roll back all changes in the even bad behavior is encountered. This provides added value for your customers as they continuously receive incremental improvements to the availability and reliability of the application platform as part of the normal application code updates. Solution providers who are able to update their software in intelligent, incremental steps are able to secure very high customer confidence and can ensure the updates are compatible with the customer's environment and their needs.


### Summary

*Harvester provides highly available virtualized and containerized infrastructures* so the application can be rebuilt into microservices over time and over many, incremental updates. This significantly lowers the risks inherent to rebuilding a legacy application because it allows developers to tackle the easiest-to-containerize parts of the application first. Later, continuing with more and more components from the virtual machine environment to the K3s Kubernetes environment.
