## Embedded SUSE Harvester Application Modernization

### The Challenge

* *Most application and integrated solutions providers rely on legacy, monolithic applications* that currently provide significant revenue for their business.
** *There is often resistance and even some fear around rebuilding*, from the ground up, the company's top money maker. Such an undertaking can incur a huge cost burden, represent a significant risk and interruption for customers. Often the task can seem so daunting that the attitude of "if it isn't broken..." can prevail. However, updating a legacy application to take advantage of microservices and Kubernetes can massively improve the application's reliability and availability. As well, a well architected microservice focused application can scale many times better than its antiquated cousin at the same time significantly reducing development, maintenance, and support costs.

* *Most virtualization and Kubernetes platforms don't allow for modernizing* monolithic applications into microservices through a safe, interactive design process.
** *One of the biggest hurdles to modernizing legacy applications* is that mode 1 technologies, such as virtual machines don't offer any means to help redevelop an application into a microservices architecture. Unfortunately, Kubernetes also offers nothing in the way to a pathway to reach the same goal. What Harvester brings to this particular table is the ability to run virtual machines in a Kubernetes context. This creates "stepping stones" for developers to begin updating their mode 1 applications. The initial steps can be to split the application into multiple VMs running in different namespaces. This introduces the ability to work with differing levels of network, storage, IPC, and process isolation; but doesn't require any other Kubernetes specific modifications. Just this one capability addresses the toughest challenge in modernizing an application, which is splitting up a monolithic application into semi-independent components without impacting the application's performance or capabilities. 

Harvester also allows application and solution providers to roll out these changes to their customers as a multi-step, iterative process rather than using the mode 1 practice of replacing the legacy application with a single, completely rebuilt product. Maintaining applications through Continuous Delivery processes is also one of the most important tenants of a microservices architecture.

* *Legacy virtualization platforms are dependent on technology that is more than two decades old.* 

* *Solution providers want to modernize their legacy applications*, but they don't have the time or resources to completely rebuild their applications into a microservice architecture. 
** SUSE Harvester provides compute, network, and storage in a physical footprint that is often identical or smaller than the requirements of a highly available, legacy application. This allows solution providers to start with a single migration to the Harvester virtual machines, which is often very easy and transparent to their customers. As the solution provider builds experience with Kubernetes and microservices, they can roll out incremental updates to their customers that slowly move application components to the highly available K3s Kubernetes cluster that also runs on Harvester.

* *There is significant risk associated with completely replacing* an active, legacy application with a re-architected implementation.
** Harvester provides highly available virtualized and containerized infrastructures so the application can be rebuild into microservices over time and over many, incremental updates. This significantly lowers the risks inherent to rebuilding a legacy application because it allows developers to tackle the easiest-to-containerize parts of the application first. Over time, and with more experience under their belts, they can continue to modernize the application, moving more and more components from the virtual machine(s) environment to the Kubernetes environment. Solution providers who are able to update their software in intelligent, incremental steps are able to secure very high customer confidence and can ensure the updates are compatible with the customer's environment and their needs.

### Architectural Overview

This design leverages many SUSE technologies. These include: 
* SUSE Rancher as a central point of management, automation, and administration for all virtualization and containerization platforms 
* SUSE Harvester as a Kubernetes based, Hyper-Converged Infrastructure, type 1 hypervisor 
* SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 and SLE Micro as the virtual machine operating systems 
** As a fully Hyper-Converged Infrastructure hypervisor, Harvester provides its workloads virtualization, storage, and network resources without additional investment.
* K3s as the Kubernetes distribution to run containerized workloads 
* SUSE Base Container Image as the Enterprise ready, fully supportable application platform.

The goal of this design is to provide a virtualization+Kubernetes platform that allows hardware/software solution providers to continue to provide their legacy applications to their customers while updating them into a microservice architecture. This SUSE, best-in-class platform allows providers to run their applications in a hybrid, virtualized plus containerized mode of operation. 

With this hybrid compute platform, the portions of an application stack that are not currently containerized run in virtual machines. Two types of virtual machines are supported, persistent and immutable. Immutable virtual machines are designed to run portions of an application stack that do not need to persist data locally, but cannot cannot be easily containerized. Leveraging immutable virtual machines can be used as an intermediate step in modernizing portions of an existing application stack. They can be operated in a mode similar to Kubernetes pods (i.e. created and destroyed at will), but the services running inside them retain the legacy application architecture.

One of the key differentiators of SUSE Harvester and other Hyper-Converged Infrastructure solutions is that Harvester, its virtual machines, as well as the K3s Kubernetes clusters can be fully managed by a single SUSE Rancher server. This allows an application development team to apply principles of automation uniformly by calling to the Rancher server API for all infrastructure needs.

For the highest level of reliability the design leverages three virtualization focused servers. The server's CPU, memory, storage, and network capacity can be tailored to the needs of the workload. The minimum recommended per node configuration is eight CPU cores, 32 GB of RAM, 120GB of SSD or NVMe storage, and 1Gb/s network. This configuration works well where the workload is relatively small and predictable. Increasing each node's capacity to 16 CPU cores, 64GB of RAM, 500GB of SSD/NVMe storage and a 25Gb/s network significantly increases the solution's ability to handle heavier and variable workloads.

Dedicating three nodes to a solution can sometimes be a challenge for remote environments, however this gives the solution the maximum availability and reliability, plus allows for fully lights-out management. The solution can also be used in a two node configuration, but with a reduction in availability and significant reduction in reliability. It would also require more on-site technical assistance to recover from major server failures. 

Absent major hardware or software failures, the two and three node designs are operated exactly the same. In the two node configuration, one node would maintain the RKE2 Kubernetes control-plane and etcd datastore as well as run virtual machines. The second node would only run virtual machines. Maintaining frequent backups of the etcd database is required to ensure recoverability in the of a major failure of the control-plane+etcd node.

The journey towards mordernizing the application is made further easier with SUSE's Base Container Image (BCI), which provides a supported, flexible container image to build from. SUSE's BCI even includes a version that allows containerized applications to interface directly with systemd of the host system. Each SUSE BCI has full access to the SUSE software repositories with, or without, a support contract. Of course, protecting your applications with a support contract ensures the highest levels of availability and the fastest time to resolution for any issues that might occur within the image.
