## Embedded SUSE Rancher for Retail Point-of-Service

SUSE Rancher provides the following capabilities for a Retail Point-of-Service use case:  
* Deploy, update, and remove Kubernetes applications automatically  
* Deploy, update, and remove Kubernetes applications on-demand  
** All container images are secured with a SHA256 hash  
* Manage RBAC consistently across Kubernetes clusters  
* Enable the application of corporate security policies across clusters based on their function in the environment  
* Change the applications on a cluster by changing the labels applied to it
** Useful when changing a POS system's location or function. I.e. Moving a management station into a Point-of-Purchase location to replace unusable systems
* Automatically configure audit logging and shipping configurations
** Ensures any intrusions cannot be covered up by the intruder

Retail environment particulars:
* Standardized on a single Point-of-Service unit
** Can be used as: 
*** Point-of-Purchase unit
*** Installed with a standardized SLEMicro+K3s image
*** Automatically imports into SUSE Rancher server
*** SUSE Rancher automatically loads Point-of-Purchase software 
*** Point-of-Service unit
*** Installed with the same standardized SLEMicro+K3s image as POP unit
*** Automatically imports into SUSE Rancher server
*** SUSE Rancher automatically loads software appropriate to function, i.e. back-office-management, shipping-and-receiving, stock-management
* Production network is completely separate from customer WiFi network
** Production network remains air-gapped except for short periods of time for uploading store data and downloading updated software
*** Opening the production network to the Internet occurs on a rotating schedule

### The Challenge

Maintaining modern applications and infrastructure at a retail location provides significant and unique challenges. Retail locations are especially vulnerable to attack because they are highly visible and rarely have the same level of high-cost network protection as does a datacenter or cloud-provider. As well, without well trained IT staff on-site, an attacker has a better chance of entering, acting and moving laterally without detection. Basing a retail location's infrastructure on a secure, transactional operating system like SUSE SLE Micro is the first step in protecting against malicious actors.

Businesses rely on a full suite of applications to run at peak efficiency and require application specialists to ensure correct configuration and optimal operation. However, it's certainly not possible to maintain application specialists at every retail location, and without the proper infrastructure, remotely managing infrastructure is cumbersome and extremely risky. Fortunately, SUSE Rancher and K3s distribution of Kubernetes are the perfect application management platform to solve this problem.

Applications and infrastructure that require an "always on" network connection from a retail location to corporate headquarters creates a massive attack surface area. Fortunately, SUSE Rancher's architecture is designed specifically for interrupted communication, both upstream and downstream. This allows the retail location to keep it's production network disconnected from the Internet for long periods of time. SUSE Rancher has no problem dealing with short, and random, windows of communication with its upstream resources. 

### Overview

This design was specifically created for a retail outlet with no on-site IT support. This design emphasizes security and ease of use for the on-site staff. Only the most basic skills of plugging in cables, powering on, and logging in are required of the on-site managers to keep a retail location running at peak efficiency. Automation through Linux network boot and SUSE Rancher complete all of the tasks needed to provision each unit to the required function. As well, the architecture is highly flexible, allowing the units to be easily moved, or replaced.

### Architecture

All Point-of-Service units are installed with the same image of SLE Micro and K3s. Using a single image on all units significantly reducing the maintenance required for the lion's share of the software stack. That SLEMicro runs as an immutable O/S in terms of installed binaries, and K3s is delivered as a single, static binary presents a much reduced attack surface area as compared to standard server operating systems and virtually any other Kubernetes distribution.

Utilizing a single O/S plus Kubernetes image across all functions leaves the uniqueness of each unit in the hands of the Kubernetes-native application layer. Upon power up, the function of the unit, i.e. point-of-purchase-lane-4 or general-manager-station can be established with cluster labels applied to the single-node K3s cluster on the unit. SUSE Rancher uses the labels to populate the unit with the applications and settings it will use in its new function. Troubleshooting problematic units is no more difficult than replacing with a spare unit.

### Application delivery and updating

As the K3s, single-node cluster on each unit is imported into the on-site SUSE Rancher server, Rancher Continuous Delivery identifies the applications the unit will need by the labels that were applied to the cluster during the login process. The appropriate Kubernetes applications are automatically deployed and run on the unit. In addition, setting that establish uniqueness of the unit, i.e. the Point of Purchase Lane 1 versus Point of Purchase Lane 2, are applied. These settings allow several things including logging of transactions and system status to be exported to an on-site central logging server.

Inevitably, applications will need updated to resolve bugs, security flaws and add new features. Rancher Continuous Delivery handles this as well. During the rotating, nightly update window Rancher Continuous Delivery will authenticate with the production GitHub compatible repository and download any software changes. These can include new applications as well as updates to existing applications. Rancher Continuous Delivery can be configured to apply the changes immediately (the preferred method), or only after the new software bundle version has been approved by on-site management team. 

### Centralized Role Based Access Control

With SUSE Rancher managing the roles and privileges granted to individual users and groups of users, every Kubernetes cluster at the retail location is guaranteed to have a consistent, well understood set of policies configured appropriately for its function.
