## Embedded SUSE Rancher for Retail Point-of-Service

SUSE Rancher provides the following capabilities for a Retail Point-of-Service use case:
* Deploy, update, and remove Kubernetes applications automatically
* Deploy, update, and remove Kubernetes applications on-demand
** All container images are secured with a SHA256 hash
* Manage RBAC consistently across Kubernetes clusters
* Enable the application of corporate security policies across clusters based on their role in the environment
* Change the applications on a cluster by changing the labels applied to it
** Useful when changing a POS system's location or function. I.e. Moving a management station into a Point of Sale location to replace unusable systems
* Automatically configure audit logging and shipping configurations
** Ensures any intrusions cannot be covered up by the intruder

Retail environment particulars:
* Standardized on two POS units
** Point of Sale only unit
*** Netboot is only option. Loads new copy of SLEMicro+K3s cloud-image on power up
*** Automatically imports into SUSE Rancher server
*** SUSE Rancher automatically loads Point of Sale software 
** More powerful service/management unit that can be used as Point of Sale role, if needed
*** Netboot is preferred option, can load local copy of SLEMicro+K3s
* Production network is completely separate from customer WiFi network
** Production network remains air-gapped except for short periods of time for uploading store data and downloading updated software
*** Opening the production network occurs on a rotating schedule
