## Embedded SUSE Rancher for Retail Point-of-Service

SUSE Rancher provides the following capabilities for a Retail Point-of-Service use case:
* Deploy, update, and remove Kubernetes applications automatically
* Deploy, update, and remove Kubernetes applications on-demand
** All container images are secured with a SHA256 hash
* Manage RBAC consistently across Kubernetes clusters
* Enable the application of corporate security policies across clusters based on their role in the environment
* Change the applications on a cluster by changing the labels applied to it
** Useful when changing a POS system's location or function. I.e. Moving a management station into a Point-of-Purchase location to replace unusable systems
* Automatically configure audit logging and shipping configurations
** Ensures any intrusions cannot be covered up by the intruder

Retail environment particulars:
* Standardized on two POS units
** Point-of-Purchase only unit
*** Netboot is only option. Loads new copy of SLEMicro+K3s cloud-image on power up
*** Automatically imports into SUSE Rancher server
*** SUSE Rancher automatically loads Point-of-Purchase software 
** More powerful Management unit that can be used as Point-of-Purchase role, if needed
*** Netboot is preferred option, can load local copy of SLEMicro+K3s
* Production network is completely separate from customer WiFi network
** Production network remains air-gapped except for short periods of time for uploading store data and downloading updated software
*** Opening the production network to the Internet occurs on a rotating schedule

### Overview

This design was specifically created for a retail outlet with no on-site IT support. Retail locations are especially vulnerable to attack because they are highly visible and rarely have the same level of high-cost network protection that a datacenter or cloud-provider has. The challenges to maintaining effective compute resources at a retail outlet are numerous.This design emphasizes security and ease of use for the on-site staff. Only the most basic skills of plugging in cables, powering on, and logging in are required of the on-site managers. Automation through Linux network boot and Rancher complete all of the tasks needed to provision each POS unit to the task required of it.

### Architecture

The lowest level of the architecture is the ability to netboot the Point-of-Purchase and management units with a validated copy of SLEMicro and K3s. This single image is delivered to all units, significantly reducing the maintenance required for the lion's share of the software stack. That SLEMicro runs as an immutable O/S in terms of installed binaries, and K3s is delivered as a single, static binary presents a much reduced attack surface area as compared to standard server operating systems and virtually any other Kubernetes distribution.

Utilizing a single O/S plus Kubernetes image across all platforms leaves the role of each unit in the hands of the Kubernetes native application layer. After netbooting a unit, the employee or manager logs into  the unit with their id and passcode. They are first met with a simple menu that allows them to select the role of the unit, i.e. point-of-purchase-lane-4 or general-manager-station. The selected role applies Kubernetes labels to the unit, which SUSE Rancher uses to
