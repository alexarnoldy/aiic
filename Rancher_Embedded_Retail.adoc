## Embedded SUSE Rancher for Retail Point-of-Service


### The Challenge

Providing modern applications and infrastructure for use at a retail location provides significant and unique challenges. Retail locations are especially vulnerable to attack because they are highly visible and rarely have the same level of high-cost network protection as does a datacenter or cloud-provider. As well, without well trained IT staff on-site, an attacker has a better chance of entering, acting and moving laterally without detection. Basing retail infrastructure components on a secure, transactional operating system like SUSE SLE Micro is the first step in protecting against malicious actors.

Businesses rely on a full suite of applications to run at peak efficiency and require application specialists to ensure correct configuration and optimal operation. However, it's certainly not possible to require customers to base application specialists at every retail location. Just the same, without the proper software orchestration tools, managing infrastructure remotely is cumbersome and extremely risky. Fortunately, SUSE Rancher and K3s distribution of Kubernetes are the perfect application management platform for any IT components destined to work in any remote location.

Applications and infrastructure that require an "always on" network connection from a retail location to corporate headquarters creates a massive attack surface area. Fortunately, SUSE Rancher's architecture is designed specifically for environments where both upstream and downstream communications are interrupted regularly. This allows the retail location to keep it's production network disconnected from the Internet for long periods of time. SUSE Rancher has no problem syncing up needed data in short and random windows of communication with its upstream resources. 

### Overview

This design was specifically created for providers of IT software and hardware designed for retail outlets with no on-site IT support. It emphasizes a high level of security, ease of management for remote IT management staff, and ease of use for on-site staff. The two primary components of the installation are the highly available installation of SUSE Rancher and the Point-of-Service units that are pre-installed with a hardened and standardized image of SLE Micro with a K3s configured as a single-node cluster. 

SUSE Rancher server provides a stable platform for the orchestration of the Kubernetes-native applications that run on the Point-of-Service units. Rancher is flexible that it can even apply different applications to units that are being used for different functions, such as a management workstation. The unique combination of SLE Micro, K3s, and Rancher is able to achieve the highest level of software stability such that only the most basic skills of plugging in cables, powering on, and logging in are usually required for retail location staff to keep their store running at peak efficiency. 

SLE Micro is an ultra-reliable, lightweight operating system purpose built for containerized and virtualized workloads. It leverages the enterprise hardened security and compliance components of SUSE Linux Enterprise and merges them with a modern, immutable, developer-friendly OS platform.

Utilizing a standardized O/S plus Kubernetes image across all Point-of-Service units significantly reduces the maintenance required for the lion's share of the software stack. This design also leaves the uniqueness of each unit in the hands of the Kubernetes-native application layer. In the dynamic environment of a retail location, these units are fully interchangeable and flexible. 

SLE Micro is a lightweight immutable OS thatâ€™s optimized for edge use cases. Its immutable design ensures OS is not altered during runtime and runs reliably every single time. Further, SLE Micro leverages enterprise-hardened SLE common code base to provide enterprise-grade quality and reliability. 

K3s is packaged as a single < 40MB binary that reduces the dependencies and steps needed to install, run and auto-update a production Kubernetes cluster. K3s run on all x86_64 platforms but is also optimized for ARM64 and ARMv7.

That SLEMicro runs as an immutable O/S in terms of installed binaries, and K3s is delivered as a single, completely static binary presents a much reduced attack surface area as compared to traditional operating systems and Kubernetes distributions.

### Architecture

Upon power up/boot up, the function of the Point-of-Service unit, i.e. point-of-purchase-lane-4 or general-manager-station can be established by applying cluster labels to the single-node K3s cluster on the unit. SUSE Rancher uses the labels to populate the unit with the applications and settings it applicable to its current function. Troubleshooting problematic units is no more difficult than replacing with a spare unit.

Effective security is applied consistently across each layer of the architecture. SUSE Rancher supports this perfectly by allows Role Based Access Control programmatically across all Points-of-Service units. This can include assuring that only management staff can access business critical units and applications.

Securing the software supply chain is one of the most important, and least understood way to protect an enterprise from attack. SUSE Rancher supports the both in the headquarters-based development, QA, and testing efforts; as well as at the on-site retail location.

SUSE Rancher maintains secure application deployment in several ways. Firstly, it ensures all on-site K3s clusters only pull images from the on-site, private registry. As well, it ensures the K3s clusters validate the SHA256 hash of every container image of the applications they run. Finally, SUSE Rancher will pull the container image hash values from the secure, corporate GitHub compatible repository, which is separate from the upstream container image registry.

### Centralized Role Based Access Control

SUSE Rancher is capable of managing the roles and privileges granted to headquarters-based as well as retail location users and groups of users. For this reason, every K3s cluster at all retail locations is guaranteed to have a consistent, well understood set of policies. Administrators can easily create configurations to allow the minimum access required for each job function. 

### Automatic Application Delivery and Management

SUSE Rancher Continuous Delivery is the key to effective application deployment and management at remote sites, including retail store locations. While its capabilities are quite advanced, its base operational methods are quite easy to understand. As the K3s, single-node cluster on each unit is imported into the on-site SUSE Rancher server, Rancher Continuous Delivery identifies the applications to be delivered to the unit based on the labels applied to the cluster. The appropriate Kubernetes applications are automatically deployed and run on the unit. In addition, settings that establish uniqueness of the unit, i.e. the Point of Purchase Lane 1 versus Point of Purchase Lane 2, are applied. These settings allow unique data, including logging of transactions and system status, to be exported to an on-site central logging server. For an optimum security posture, it is recommended that the logging server be separate from the SUSE Rancher cluster.

Inevitably, applications will need updated to resolve bugs, security flaws and add new features. Rancher Continuous Delivery handles this as well. During the rotating, nightly update window Rancher Continuous Delivery will authenticate with the production GitHub compatible repository and download any software changes. These can include new applications as well as updates to existing applications. Rancher Continuous Delivery can be configured to apply the changes immediately, or only after the new software bundle version has completed an established approval process.

### On-Demand Application Delivery and Management

While some applications, like those supporting a point-of-purchase unit are best deployed and run automatically, certain applications are best deployed and run only when needed. These would include applications that have high resource consumption or would benefit from a reduced attack surface area. For this reason SUSE Rancher allows deploying, running, and removing applications on-demand from its application catalog. After all, it's hard to imagine a smaller attack surface than an application that isn't currently installed. This ability is, of course, restricted by Rancher centralized Role Based Access Control.


### Kubernetes Level Audit Logging

One of the most valuable tool Kubernetes provides as an application platform is the ability to constantly monitor and log all requests made to the Kubernetes cluster. This information is invaluable in discovering unexpected queries and changes. As well, continuously sending these logs to an on-site, central logging service, makes it quicker to detect intrusions, and much harder for intruders to cover their tracks.
